        <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the Tripadvisor websites and mobile properties located at www.tripadvisor.com and applicable country top level domains (including sub-domains associated with them), related software applications (sometimes referred to as “apps”), data, SMS, APIs, email, chat and telephone correspondence, buttons, widgets and ads (collectively, all of these items shall be referred to herein as the “Services”; more generally, the Tripadvisor websites and mobile properties shall hereinafter be referred to herein as “websites”).</p>

        <p>The Services are provided by Tripadvisor LLC, a Delaware limited liability company located in the United States of America (“Tripadvisor”) with its registered office at Tripadvisor LLC, 400 1st Avenue, Needham, MA 02494, USA. The terms “we”, “us”, “our” shall be construed accordingly.</p>

        <p>By creating a Tripadvisor account, you agree to be bound by the terms, conditions and notices set forth below (collectively, this “Agreement”). This Agreement does not apply to if you merely browse the websites or use the Services without creating a Tripadvisor account. Please read this Agreement carefully, as it contains information concerning your legal rights and limitations on these rights, as well as a section regarding applicable law and jurisdiction of disputes. If you are a consumer in the EU or UK you have a legal right to withdraw from this Agreement within 14 days of the Agreement being made. You can do this, or terminate this Agreement at any other time, by closing your account (by contacting us or by accessing “Account Info” whilst logged in and selecting the “close account” option) and no longer accessing or using the Services.</p>

        <p>If you are a consumer in the EU or UK you will have certain mandatory consumer rights. If you are a consumer living elsewhere, you may also have consumer rights under the laws of your territory. Nothing in this Agreement affects your mandatory consumer rights.</p>

        <p>Any information, text, links, graphics, photos, audio, videos, data, code or other materials or arrangements of materials that you can view on, access or otherwise interact with through the Services shall be referred to as “Content”. “Services” as defined above refers to those provided by Tripadvisor or our corporate affiliates (Tripadvisor and such entities, when one or more are referred to, shall be collectively defined as the “Tripadvisor Companies”). For the avoidance of doubt, the websites are all owned and controlled by Tripadvisor. However, some specific Services made available via the websites may be owned and controlled by Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates, for example Services facilitating the booking of Holiday Rentals, Restaurant Reservations and Experiences with third-party suppliers (see below). As part of our Services, we may send you notifications about special offers, products, or additional services available from us, our affiliates, or our partners, that may be of interest to you. Such notifications will typically be sent through newsletters and marketing communications and represent efforts to get to know you and your preferences better across our Services and those of our affiliates. In turn, this enables customisation of the services in line with those preferences.</p>

        <p>The term “you” or "user" refers to the individual, company, business organisation or other legal entity which has created a Tripadvisor account and uses the Services and/or contributes Content to them. The Content that you contribute, submit, transmit and/or post to or through the Services shall be referred to variously as “your Content”, “Content of yours” and/or “Content you submit.”</p>

        <p>The Services are provided on an ongoing basis, and are provided solely to:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Assist users in gathering travel information, posting Content and searching for and booking travel services and reservations; and</li>
            <li>Assist travel, tourism and hospitality businesses in engaging with users and potential customers, by way of free and/or paid-for services offered by or through the Tripadvisor Companies.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Products, services, information and Content on our Services change regularly, so that it is up to date (for example, with current information and offers). This means, for example, that in respect of third party services, new transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences may become available for you to book whilst other services may become unavailable.</p>

        <p>We may change or otherwise modify this Agreement in the future in accordance with the terms and conditions herein, and you understand and agree that your continued access or use of the Services after such change signifies your acceptance of the updated or modified Agreement. We will note the date that revisions were last made to this Agreement at the bottom of this Agreement, and any revisions will take effect upon posting. We will notify you of material changes to these terms and conditions by either sending a notice to the email address associated with your profile or by placing a notice on our websites. Be sure to return to this page periodically to review the most current version of this Agreement. If you don't want to accept any changes to this Agreement, you may close your account and cease to access the Services (a description of how to do so is available here).</p>

Please be aware that third party sites and apps may publicly display such shared Content. Such third parties may charge a fee for use of certain content or services provided on or by way of their websites. Therefore, you should make whatever investigation you feel is necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any transaction with any third party to determine whether a charge will be incurred. Where the Tripadvisor Companies provide details of fees or charges for such third party content or services, such information is provided for convenience and information purposes only. Any interactions with third party sites and apps are at your own risk.

        <p>Tripadvisor Companies rank and present listings to you using recommender systems. Different categories of listings (such as hotels and restaurants, things to do and flights) are ranked based on different criteria, such as price, "traveller favourites" and duration. Full details of our policy and criteria for ranking can be found on the How the Site Works webpage.</p>

        <p>Some Content you see or otherwise access on or through the Services is used for commercial purposes. You agree and understand that the Tripadvisor Companies may place advertising and promotions on the Services alongside, near, adjacent or otherwise in close proximity to your Content (including, for video or other dynamic content, before, during or after its presentation), as well as the Content of others.</p>

        <h2>Additional Products</h2>
        <p>The Tripadvisor Companies may, from time to time, decide to change, update or discontinue certain products and features of the Services. You agree and understand that the Tripadvisor Companies have no obligation to store or maintain your Content or other information you provide, except to the extent required by applicable law.</p>

        <p>We also offer other services that may be governed by additional terms or agreements. If you use any other such services, the additional terms will be made available and will become part of this Agreement, except where such additional terms expressly exclude or otherwise supersede this Agreement. For example, if you use or purchase such additional services for commercial or business purposes, you must agree to the applicable additional terms. To the extent any other terms conflict with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the additional terms shall govern to the extent of the conflict with respect to those specific services.</p>

        <p>The Content and information available on and through the Services (including, but not limited to, messages, data, information, text, music, sound, photos, graphics, video, maps, icons, software, code or other material), as well as the infrastructure used to provide such Content and information, is proprietary to the Tripadvisor Companies or licensed to the Tripadvisor Companies by third parties.
